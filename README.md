# 🌀 Transcendence

A 3D web game project built with **Babylon.js** using a **microservice architecture** orchestrated with **Docker**.  
The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Fastify**, with asynchronous communication between services via a **message broker**, and centralized logging using the **ELK stack**.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Frontend: Babylon.js SPA served via Nginx
- Backend: Node.js + Fastify
- API Gateway: Fastify + Docker
- Message Broker: RabbitMQ (or Kafka)
- CDN: Nginx
- Auth: JWT + OAuth2 (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Logging: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Monitoring: Docker healthchecks + auto-restart
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Dev Tools: Makefile for automation
